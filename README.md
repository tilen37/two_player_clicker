My first Flutter App

It contains only few functions and some low level animations using only AnimatedContainers and not yet animation controllers

It should be played by two players each using only a single finger.

I had a problem with multitouch and it`s ability to block other touches so one can stop the score from changing by simply pressing on the screen with two fingers and then releasing one of them so he is left with one finger on the screen.

Game is a clicker game where you get +1 point and your opponent -1 point for every tap you do. The goal is to get from 0 to 10 points.
